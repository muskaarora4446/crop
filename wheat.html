        <p class="para">
            Wheat is the main cereal crop in India. The total area under the crop is about 29.8
            million hectares in the country. The production of wheat in the country has increased
            significantly from 75.81 million MT in 2006-07 to an all time record high of 94.88
            million MT in 2011-12. The productivity of wheat which was 2602 kg/hectare in 2004-05
            has increased to 3140 kg/hectare in 2011-12. The major increase in the productivity
            of wheat has been observed in the states of Haryana, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. Higher
            area coverage is reported from MP in recent years.</p>
        <p class="para">
            Indian wheat is largely a soft/medium hard, medium protein, white bread wheat, somewhat
            similar to U.S. hard white wheat. Wheat grown in central and western India is typically
            hard, with high protein and high gluten content. India also produces around 1.0-1.2
            million tons of durum wheat, mostly in the state of Madhya Pradesh. Most Indian
            durum is not marketed separately due to segregation problems in the market yards.
            However, some quantities are purchased by the private trade at a price premium,
            mainly for processing of higher value/branded products.</p>
        <p class="para">
            The production and productivity of Wheat crop were quite low, when India became
            independent in 1947. The production of Wheat was only 6.46 million tonnes and productivity
            was merely 663 kg per hectare during 1950-51, which was not sufficient to feed the
            Indian population. The Country used to import Wheat in large quantities for fulfilling
            the needs of our people from many countries like USA under PL-480. The reasons of
            low production and productivity of Wheat at that time was (a) the tall growing plant
            habit resulting in lodging, when grown under fertile soils, (b) the poor tillering
            and low sink capacity of the varieties used, (c) higher susceptibility to diseases,
            (d) the higher sensitivity to thermo &amp; photo variations, etc., resulting in
            poor adaptability, and (e) longer crop duration resulting in a long exposure of
            plants to the climatic variations and insect pest / disease attacks.</p>
        <p class="para">
            The Government of India appointed a commission in 1961 to assess the feasibility
            of increasing the crop productivity under prevailing Indian ecological conditions.
            As result of various steps taken by Govt. of India, the Wheat scenario in our country
            has completely changed. In the post Independence era, country used to import Wheat
            for our needs but due to bumper increase in the production and productivity of Wheat
            in the 'Green Revolution' period in late sixties, our country became self dependent
            in Wheat production. At present, country is producing much more excess Wheat than
            the requirement and Godowns are over-flooded with Wheat.</p>

        <p class="para">
            Wheat crop has wide adaptability. It can be grown not only in the tropical and sub-tropical
            zones, but also in the temperate zone and the cold tracts of the far north ,beyond
            even the 60 degree north altitude . Wheat can tolerate severe cold and snow and
            resume growth with the setting in of warm weather in spring .It can be cultivated
            from sea level to as high as 3300 meters.</p>
        <p class="para">
            The best wheat are produced in areas favoured with cool, moist weather during the
            major portion of the growing period followed by dry, warm weather to enable the
            grain to ripen properly. The optimum temperature range for ideal germination of
            wheat seed is 20-25 C though the seeds can germinate in the temperature range 3.5
            to 35 c. Rains just after sowing hamper germination and encourage seedling blight.
            Areas with a warm and damp climate are not suited for wheat growing.</p>
        <p class="para">
            During the heading and flowering stages, excessively high or low temperatures and
            drought are harmful to wheat. Cloudy weather, with high humidity and low temperatures
            is conducive for rust attack. Wheat plant requires about 14-15 c optimum average
            temperature at the time of ripening . The temperature conditions at the time of
            grain filling and development are very crucial for yield. Temperatures above 250c
            during this period tend to depress grain weight. When temperatures are high, too
            much energy I lost through the process of transpiration by the plants and the reduced
            residual energy results in poorer grain formation and lower yields. Wheat is mainly
            a rabi (winter) season crop in India.</p>
        <span class="titlebold2"><h3>Soil </h3></span>
        <p class="para">
            Wheat is grown in a variety of soils of India. Soils with a clay loam or loam texture,
            good structure and moderate water holding capacity are ideal for wheat cultivation.
            Care should be taken to avoid very porous and excessively drained oils. Soil should
            be neutral in its reaction. Heavy soil with good drainage are suitable for wheat
            cultivation under dry conditions. These soils absorb and retain rain water well.
            Heavy soils with poor structure and poor drainage are not suitable as wheat is sensitive
            to water logging. Wheat can be successfully grown on lighter soils provided their
            water and nutrient holding capacity are improved.</p>
